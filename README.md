## What is the SCP Foundation?
The SCP Foundation is a horror-themed collaborative writing project. The story centers around the foundation's mission to protect humanity from potentially dangerous creatures and objects that do not conform to our understanding of reality.

## What is RAISA for?
My app is essentially a mobile version of the [SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com), the website where authors post their stories. What sets it apart from the wiki, is that you can download, track read articles, and save your position in one. All without relying on your browser. RAISA also has no ads ;).

## Where can I get it?
You can download the app on the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raisa/id6450128043).
RAISA is currently only on iOS, and there are no plans for an Android version yet.

Thanks for your time!
