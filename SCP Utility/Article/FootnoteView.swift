Any credible information regarding activity arising from EE-00059's vicinity should first be traced to its original source, then delegitimized by any means necessary. These tactics are to be carried out by embedded agents stationed in various observatories, places of academia, and media outlets such as television studios and radio stations.//}},,

**Event Description:**  Extranormal Event 00059 was observed on June 14th, 2006, in a region of space roughly 1.6 billion light years from Earth,[[footnote]]Therefore indicating its origin to be ~1.6 billion years in the past.[[/footnote]] located in the constellation Indus. It was detected via the Neil Gehrels //Swift// Observatory telescope system as a prolonged gamma ray burst designated [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_060614 GRB 060614].

EE-00059-1 is an emergent Class-E "Momentary Lapse of Reason" Wormhole (S-CSMWAUC2T)[[footnote]]Spatial, Cycling Stability, Stationary, Manifested, Wide-Area, Uncertain, Conditional Two-Way, Transient.
